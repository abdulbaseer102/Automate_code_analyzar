# Python Code Analyzer with CrewAI

## About the Project

This project is an AI-powered Python Code Analyzer built using CrewAI. It utilizes an AI agent to review Python code, identify errors, and provide insights for optimization. The agent is powered by the `crewAI` framework and uses the `CodeInterpreterTool` for advanced code execution and analysis.

## Features

- AI-driven code analysis
- Highlights potential errors and inefficiencies
- Provides optimization suggestions for Python code
- Uses CrewAI agents for structured task execution
